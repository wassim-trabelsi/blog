# Welcome

:wave: Wassim here, i'm a passionate ML Engineer specialized in optimizing LLM applications.

## What I Do

I work at [Iadvize](https://www.iadvize.com/) Paris on **LLM & RAG systems at production scale**. My work includes, building **evaluation**, **observability**, optimizing **retrieval**, and developing the use of **agentic** systems.

Through all the improvements in my company, we've achieved and measured 20%+ performance gains through a consistant & scientific methodology.

At [Iadvize](https://www.iadvize.com/) we are building ai assistants for e-commerce handling _100K+_ conversations per day, connecting _1M+_ users with _10M+_ products.

## Experience Highlights

- **5 years** delivering production Data/ML solutions.
- Built RAG systems at scale
- Migrated AI workflows to agentic architectures, improving quality and generalisation.
- **Kaggle Silver Medal** (Top 5%) in NFL Helmets Detection competition

## What You'll Find Here

I share practical lessons from building production AI systems. The kind of insights that save you hours of debugging and help you ship better models faster.

**Topics I write about:**

- **RAG Systems** - Real-world patterns that actually work at scale
- **LLM Optimization** - Tricks to improve quality without breaking the bank
- **Evaluation & Observability** - How to measure what matters
- **Vector Search** - Beyond the basics of embeddings and retrieval
- **Agentic Systems** - When to use them (and when not to)
- **Math** - My passion, where i build my intuition about stuffs

No fluff, just things I wish I knew earlier.

## Why ?

Writing helps me think clearly and solidify what I've learned. It's primarily for myself, but if it helps others along the way, that's even better.

## Education

**CentraleSupelec** - Master in Computer Science with major in Applied Mathematics, Data Science and AI

**Lycée Louis Le Grand** - Elite preparation to engineer entrance exams. Focused on maths & physics.
