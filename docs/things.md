# Things I Use

Tools that power my daily workflow for development, documentation, and thinking.

## Development

**[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** - AI-powered code editor built on VS Code. My primary development environment for writing code with AI assistance. Although, i like more the intellij PyCharm suit for debbuging. I managed to shift bewteen the best of two worlds.

## Note-Taking & Thinking

**[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** - Knowledge base and note-taking app using markdown files. I use it for technical notes, tech schema, local storing, project documentation, and personal knowledge management. It's soooo good and way better than Notion because you store and handles all the files by yourself.

**[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)** - Hand-drawn style diagramming tool. Perfect for sketching architecture diagrams, system designs, and visual thinking. Works seamlessly with Obsidian for inline diagrams.
