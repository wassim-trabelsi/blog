# Books

Books that i like the most are at the intersection of psychology & mathematics

## Psychology & Decision-Making

**Thinking, Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman  
The book that made me realize how often I'm wrong without knowing it. Kahneman breaks down how we think into two systems the quick, gut-feeling one and the slow, analytical one. Changed how I approach decisions, especially when I catch myself being overconfident.

**Predictably Irrational** by Dan Ariely  
I love this book, it combines mathematics & decision theory. Although, define rationnality spots that are never in the real life respected.

**Never Split the Difference** by Chris Voss  
Former FBI hostage negotiator's tactical approach to negotiation. Although, not that much appliable for myself, as i rarely negociate with someone-else than my computer :joy:

## Fiction

**The Three-Body Problem** by Liu Cixin  
Hard science fiction exploring first contact and the dark forest theory. Part of the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy.
